## 🛡️ How Fake Job Detection Works

Our system uses a multi-layered approach:

1.  **URL Analysis**: Checks TLDs, keyword spoofing, and domain age.
2.  **Metadata Check**: Verifies company reputations and email domains.
3.  **Pattern Matching**: Detects "Too-Good-To-Be-True" salary offers and suspicious requirements.
